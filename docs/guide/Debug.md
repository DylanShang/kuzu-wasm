## Debug
I debug using Chrome DevTools as described in this [blog post](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/wasm-debugging-2020/), which takes a few steps to set up. The first is to install the [C/C++ DevTools Support Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cc%20%20-devtools-support-dwa/pdcpmagijalfljmkmjngeonclgbbannb) and to enable **WebAssembly Debugging: Enable DWARF support** in the DevTools settings.
